# AudioExtraction
Code which inputs a given wav file and outputs the plot along with the corresponding spectrogram. Additionally, plots mixtures of sounds such as overlaying two different sound sources.

## Put given audio files in the audio_files folder
Run notebook for Plotwav_signal.ipynb cell by cell to plot the sound file (remember to change the name of the file input before running). Code can generate individual plots of sounds for the sound wave as well as mixtures of sound wave plots. Can also generate individual spectrograms per sound.

Use ExampleMixtureSpectrogram.ipynb to plot mixtures of sounds and output spectrogram containing the mixture.
